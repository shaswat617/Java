# Git Setup initially

1. First create a repo in GitHub
2. git clone that repo into local
3. git pull
4. git status
5. git add . [. not always but if we want to add all files into that repo ]
6. git branch
7. git commit -am "<commit_name>"
8. git branch
9. From breadcrumb menu at top of IntelliJ IDEA, then navigate to Git. Click on Push
10. Then again click on Push

git diff : Difference between local main branch and current status

# Create new branch
1. git checkout -b shaswat [new branch will be created on local]

# Switch from one branch to another branch
1. git checkout <branch_name> [based on where we want to switch]


# Git Push New changes
1. git pull origin main
[ remote main branch to local current branch all changes will be pulled ]
[ git pull means it tracks remote/origin main branch with local main branch ]

git status

2. git add <file name>
3. git commit -am "commit_message" [a = add, m = commit message]
4. git commit -m "commit_message" [ m = commit message]
[ already added will be commited to local current branch ]
5. git push origin main
git push origin shaswat : local shaswat branch -> remote /origin/shaswat

# Pull Request [PR]
remote shaswat -> remote main
[once PR is approved by lead who reviews the code in remote shaswat branch]

White : Pushed to main branch in local
Blue : Modified – changed since last push in local main.
Green : New file – added to Git but not yet committed (staged).
Red : Unversioned – not yet added to Git.

When we type git status, and the output of the command shows a file 2 time i.e new and modified
that means that file is already added but not commited and 2nd point is
that file is a modified file not a new file.

Untracked file : Red : Unversioned – not yet added to Git.
git add <file_location from current directory> [ selected file will be shortlisted for
further actions like commiting / pushing ]

# git log
it will log all the commits
where ? local main / remote main
use up and down arrows to navigate through all the commits recently
