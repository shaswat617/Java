// Abstract class :
// 1. no method definition
// 2. only method declaration
// 3. we cannot create objects for abstract class
// 4. We have to / must inherit abstract class and we can create object of inherited class only. In that
// inherited class itself, we have to / must provide method definition
/*
   5. If a class has a single abstract method, we have to declare that class as abstract

   For eg :
   If a class has 50 methods, out of which 49 are non-abstract and only one is abstract, then we must declare that class
   as abstract class.
   Basically, this also means an abstract class can contain both abstract and non-abstract methods.

   But a normal class, can contain only non-abstract methods

   6. We cannot declare an abstract class as final because once a class is declared as final then that class cannot be
    inherited
    7. it provides security

Interface :
1.We cannot create objects for Interfaces
2. Interfaces can be inherited using implements keyword. If we are implementing an interface, then we need to provide
method definition for all its methods.
3. Interface -> Interface extends keyword
4. Class can implement Interface using implements keyword
5. Interface consists of only abstract methods
6. it provides security
7. We can create object of implemented class
8. Interfaces cannot be declared as final
